# Unsolved mystery of Cicada 3301

After one year they release another image with official PGP signature. (PGP signature is their authentication code along with every clue. This allowed users to verify that an image or message was from Cicada.) So, Cicada was back, and it was time for round two.

The second puzzle was not dissimilar from the first. This image enclosed message, the message leads to a book, the book produced a link, and gradually the puzzle unfolded.
At one point of the solving this puzzle a recording titled “The Instar Emergency” was uncovered. Moreover, another clue leads to a cryptic twitter account which then leads to an image.
So much like the first puzzle, the second swelled into the physical world with 8 locations in 4 different countries. Such as Russia, USA, Japan

However, the trail went cold once again.  Another selected group of first arrivals had been accepted into a final private stage of the puzzle.

To be continued.
