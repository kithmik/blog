# Truth about Bitcoin

A Bitcoin is one unit of digital currency. It also called as internet money. So, let us start at the very beginning by understanding the history of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto was an anonymous person or group who published a document in an online cryptography forum in November 2008 and revealed the first details of how Bitcoin would work. Also, also, it described as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.

It is a straightforward method to send money between two people each other no matter where they are in the world. The first release for Bitcoin was version 0.1. Satoshi wrote this version in C++ programming language, and it was published on SourceForge in January 2009 under the open-source MIT license. 
Unlike dollars, or euros, or yen, Bitcoin is considered a decentralized currency. That means it does not have any centralized authority or institution to operate, like a bank or a government. Once the money is exchanged, the record of the transaction is publicly recorded onto a ledger known as a blockchain.

Bitcoin was very first blockchain in the world. This method provides data redundancy and makes sure the data is never lost but also provides a way for anyone to verify the transactions in the database themselves. 
A block in the database stores a sequence of transactions, and a sequence of blocks is called a blockchain. Each block is identified by an incrementing number and a unique SHA256 hash. The hash for a block is calculated using the transactions inside of it as well as the previous block's hash, which forms a chain of hashes. The data in the blocks is secured using a cryptographic algorithm called proof-of-work. Which also keeps all members of the network and the database in sync to prevent double spending. Preventing double-spending means preventing anyone from spending money they don't have.

Proof-of-work is used to generate new blocks for the database, also known as mining, and the reward for mining a new block is given to the miner by creating new Bitcoins in the system. This method is the only way to create new Bitcoins. However, 21 million amount of Bitcoins that can ever be created. Any user on the network can be a miner.

In the first step, you first need to have a Bitcoin account to send a Bitcoin transaction. An account can be created very easily by generating a cryptographic key pair which generates a public key and a private key. A hash of the public key is used as your account address, and your private key is kept the secret to prove that you have ownership of this account. To send any Bitcoin, you first need to get some from someone else.

After Bitcoin released, there were several projects developed using the Bitcoin source code and modified. Some projects are Namecoin and Litecoin
