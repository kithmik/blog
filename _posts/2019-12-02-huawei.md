# Huawei banned from using Google apps on its devices 

What happens if you immediately lost access to the Google Play store, youtube, or google services.   So now Huawei loses access going forward to proprietary apps from Google. So, this will lose access to Gmail, YouTube, and Google services such as the entire Play Store, security updates, etc.

And it is going to be significant implications on the smartphone market. In this article, I want to talk about those implications but also just give you some information regarding this.

However, there is no ban on the Android operating system since it is an open source software.
According to Reuters, Google will stop providing Huawei with access to technical support and its proprietary apps and services. However, there is no ban on the Android operating system since it is an open source software. Even though the base of the operating system is open-source, it's actually pretty useless without Google services.

If you don't have access to them, then you've got some significant issues. But existing User of Huawei devices who have access to the Google Play Store will still be able to download the app, and you can still receive updates through that. Even if you use Google services such as YouTube, then you still won't be affected. However, new smartphones manufactured by the company will not be able to use the Google Play Store or Google services.

But in China, they already use their own app store called AppGallery. This is a completely separate
Chinese based app store that is not anything to do with the Google Play Store. This has lots of apps and Chinese versions of apps from Chinese based companies. Such as 10-cent and Baidu and various other big companies in China that make all sorts of apps. But these apps are absolutely no use outside of China. In China, they provide a lot of different service providers in
China. for example, you can't use Facebook, but you can use Weibo. You can't use YouTube, but you can use Bijan, yoku, ite, or many other different video streaming apps. You can't use WhatsApp or Viber, but you can use WeChat. So this app gallery includes every single service and app in your Huawei Phone with the Chinese version.

In this situation, Huawei organization definitely will have plans in place for developing its own Operating System and actually, the solutions around this problem are already in use in China. 
In the situation, Huawei has access to Android so developers that have apps on the Google Play Store will also apply to put their apps on any Huawei app store.

But as consumers, if the access to Google services is blocked on Huawei devices, then what you're going to do? Probably you look at a phone that does have access to Google services.

But inside the consumers cannot Use any kind of google services on any device. But on the
outside world, if you have the choice between one device that has access to everything and one device that doesn't, the choice is actually incredibly simple which one you go for. so it looks like
the industry is going to be impacted by this for sure and if you're looking for alternatives then it seems like BBK (Electronics Corporation in China. Some products are oppo, vivo,  oneplus.) might be the winners out of this they might be looking forward to a sales boost outside of China in the near future
