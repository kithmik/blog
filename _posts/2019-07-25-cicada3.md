#### The end 

When the initial image appeared 4chan in 2012, there were many assumptions about this mystery. Some are assumed Cicada 3301 is reality game design by a corporation to promote a new service or product. However, the release of the puzzle and the complete lack of commercialization has more or less eliminated that possibility.
Cicada describes itself as an international group who believe that privacy is an inalienable right. Each puzzle aims to recruit like-minded individuals to develop intelligent privacy solution.
So some accepted individual from final stage told Cicada 3301 had been founded by a group of friends who shared common ideas about security, privacy, and censorship. As a friend recruit friends, this secret quickly expands all over the world as an international organization. The recruits have the task to develop software that fit the ideology of the organization. 
At last, Cicada made their last public post warning about disinformation in April of 2017. However, the current status of the puzzle and the possibility of the fourth puzzle remains at that moment.
